// NOTE: When revising these documentation blocks, they are duplicated in:
//   - MIDIFileEvent enum case (`case keySignature(delta:event:)`, etc.)
//   - MIDIFileEvent static constructors (`static func keySignature(...)`, etc.)
//   - MIDIFileEvent concrete payload structs (`KeySignature`, etc.)
//   - DocC documentation for each MIDIFileEvent type
