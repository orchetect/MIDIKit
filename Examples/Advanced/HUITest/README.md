# HUI Test Example

## Supported Platforms

- macOS

## Overview

This is a debugging workhorse that was used while developing the HUI components of MIDIKit.

Host host and client are modeled, fully functional and essentially feature-complete.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The SwiftUI implementation is not fully optimized and may be laggy and/or CPU-intensive under heavy HUI activity.
