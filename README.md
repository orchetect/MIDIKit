An elegant and modern CoreMIDI wrapper in pure Swift supporting MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0.

- Modular, user-friendly I/O
- Automatic MIDI endpoint connection management and identity persistence
- Strongly-typed MIDI events that seamlessly interoperate between MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0
- Automatically uses appropriate Core MIDI API and defaults to MIDI 2.0 on platforms that support it
- Supports Swift Playgrounds on iPad and macOS
- Swift 6 strict concurrency compliant
- Full documentation available online and in Xcode Documentation browser, including helpful guides and getting started information

## Abstractions

Additional abstractions for MIDI extensions can be found in MIDIKit:

- Reading/writing Standard MIDI Files (SMF)
- Control Surface protocols (HUI, etc.)
- Synchronization protocols (MTC, etc.)

## Getting Started

The library is available as a Swift Package Manager (SPM) package.

Use the URL `https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit` when adding the library to a project or Swift package.

See the [getting started guide](https://orchetect.github.io/MIDIKit/documentation/midikit/midikit-getting-started) for a detailed walkthrough of how to get the most out of MIDIKit.

## Documentation

See the [online documentation](https://orchetect.github.io/MIDIKit/) or view it in Xcode's documentation browser by selecting the **Product ‚Üí Build Documentation** menu.

This includes a getting started guide, links to examples, and troubleshooting tips.

## System Compatibility

- Xcode 16.0 is the minimum requirement to compile
- Once compiled, MIDIKit supports macOS 10.13+, iOS/iPadOS 12.0+ and visionOS 1.0+

  *tvOS and watchOS platforms do not have MIDI support, as there is no Core MIDI implementation in the operating systems, but MIDIKit will build successfully on those platforms if used as a dependency in multi-platform projects*
